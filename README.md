# Artificial Intelligence for Multi Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent to tackle, and the coordination and collaboration between autonomous agents is the key to bring such systems to their full potential. In this project, a set of autonomous vehicles are coordinated to collaborate on a variety of problems, in a simulated UNITY environment with obstacles to avoid.

# (1) Path Planner
  - PD controller
  - Vehicle routing problem with DFS/BFS

***

# (2) Coordination
  - We use Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to perform Vacuum Cleaner Planning
  - Minimum Set Cover to solve Indoor UGV search.
  - V-shape formation for formation sweep
  - Dijkstra algorithm for planning shooter coordination of three vehicles.
